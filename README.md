# Logistic-Application-for-Developing-Countries
Create a WEB Non-Profit logistic application in developing countries, all aspects have to be covered dynamically (every stuff should be adjustable by the final user easily) then we'd be able to cover all their needs.

We think using an PHP framwork then people/institution in developing countries can upload it easily without much configuration vs JavaEE (EJB, JSF...).

By time, will be looking for a sponsor who can share a dedicated server to host this application for people over there who has a limited access to a laptop, then they may handle their logistics via their smartphones.
